## About
This is a [Meteor](https://meteor.com) package used to as a wrapper for the [Bootstrap Material Design](https://github.com/tsega/bootstrap-material-design).

The package is sourced from the recently [unsupported meteor code](https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design/issues/930).

> Material Design for Bootstrap is a Bootstrap V3 compatible theme; it is an easy way to use the new [Material Design guidelines by Google](https://material.google.com/) in your Bootstrap 3 based application.
Just include the theme, after the Bootstrap CSS and include the JavaScript at the end of your document (just before the `</body>` tag), and everything will be converted to Material Design (Paper) style.
